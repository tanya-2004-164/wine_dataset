𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙡𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙍𝙚𝙙 𝙒𝙞𝙣𝙚 𝙌𝙪𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙮 Dataset📊

I recently worked on a project where I explored a dataset on red wine quality, and I'd like to share my key findings and takeaways:

📌𝙇𝙤𝙖𝙙𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙚𝙩: I used Hugging Face's datasets library to load the dataset, which consisted of 12 features and 1599 entries.

📌𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙤 𝙋𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙖𝙨 𝘿𝙖𝙩𝙖𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚: I converted the dataset to a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

📌𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙡𝙤𝙧𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖: I used various methods such as head(), info(), and describe() to get a better understanding of the data.

📌𝙃𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙡𝙚𝙙 𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙫𝙖𝙡𝙪𝙚𝙨: I checked for missing values using isnull() and removed them using dropna() to ensure the data was clean and reliable.

📌𝙄𝙙𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙛𝙞𝙚𝙙 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙧𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙫𝙚𝙙 𝙤𝙪𝙩𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙧𝙨: I used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and remove outliers, which helped to improve the accuracy of the data.

📌𝙑𝙞𝙨𝙪𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙯𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖: I used box plots to visualize the data and see the changes after removing outliers.

📌𝙆𝙚𝙮 𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨: The dataset showed a range of values for each feature, with some features having a larger range than others.

📌𝙏𝙖𝙠𝙚𝙖𝙬𝙖𝙮𝙨: This project taught me the importance of data preprocessing and visualization in understanding and working with datasets.
